I keep telling myself I need to find a way to express my thoughts on web development and web design. A personalized place where i can tinker and experiment with various design and development techniques which keep popping in my mind far beyond working hours. A place for practice, a place to learn. Not trying to become a famous blogger, nor trying to be fancy or whatever. How corny it may sounds, but true: I just want to write about stuff I find interesting and learn from the "thinking while writing phase" people undergo when blogging. 
What i find interesting? Read on...

#Web Development
During my bachelor, at the age of 18 or so, I realized that I wanted to create interactive and beautiful web products. So naturally I started out doing front-end development (at this point in time I didn't even knew the difference between back-end and front-end).  
Not short after I realized that, in order to create something fully interactive, I needed databases and various back-end magic. So I started looking into that magic as well, and here I am. A back-end and front-end wizard in the making.

##Front-end Development

My skillset in front-end development is the most comprehensive. A couple of technologies I can't miss in my daily workflow:

-	<a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> & <a target="_blank" href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>
-	<a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>
-	<a href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>
-	HTML5 & CSS3

	  <figcaption>Yeoman's iconic character. Original on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman">Yeoman's official github</a></figcaption>
</figure>


A couple of front-end frameworks I'm looking into a lot:

-	<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
-	<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb Foundation</a>
-	<a href="http://purecss.io/" target="_blank">Yahoo's Pure CSS</a>

Knowing some languages and frameworks isn't enough though. A practical understanding of techniques, tricks and trends is just as essential as book-knowledge. Keeping up to date with the latest happenings in the web world is exciting cause of its everchanging nature. Of all the new techniques coming and go, Responsive Design is definitely a game changer and robust enough to stay.

A decent front-end developer can't go without a comprehensive knowledge of CSS3 media queries for screen adaption nowadays.

##Back-end Development
As much as I'm passionate about front-end technologies, I am about back-end technologies. When stating that my front-end development skillset is the most comprohensive of the two. It isn't because a lack of passion that one is more falling behind than the other. It's more a matter of lack of time and opportunities given in client's projects.  
The two languages I daily use are:

- PHP
- Ruby

Whilst the three itemed list above doesn't seem like much quantitatively. There are just endless programming patterns and frameworks available for these.

Frameworks I experminent or work(ed) with for web apps:

- <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="http://www.appcelerator.com/">Appcelerator</a> (native mobile apps from JavaScript)
- <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>(my favorite)


<figure class="fit shadow-on">
	<img itemprop="image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/rails4book.jpg" alt="Agile Web Development with Rails 4 book cover">
	  <figcaption> <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>, co-authored by the creator, <a target="_blank" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> himself</figcaption>
</figure>

Ruby on Rails (ROR) is my favorite cause it's one of those frameworks that, with the help of its rich community, is adapting and evolving blazingly fast to the changing webworld. Besides, it teaches and makes you aware of the bulletproof best-practices and agile techniques out there. This in turn will make the user a better developer + teammember in general IMO.

As a matter of effect I'm currently working on an exciting new webservice using Ruby on Rails. Can't wait to show you a preview or demo in the near future.

When it comes to creating websites my clients (userwise) and me (developerwise) are big fans of the <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>  CMS. I've had no problems with crafting custom Wordpress themes for clients from scratch. A client wanting to go from a simple WordPress website to a full e-commerce solution is easy as 1 2 3. 
Talking about themes, I'm thinking of creating a custom WordPress theme with this blog's design. It's currently build using <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> since I'm planning on keeping this blog as simple as possible. But more on this in a later post.

I'm hoping to write about above techniques and technologies in this blog. And for that I'm planning on using code samples in future posts as well. Just to let you know, a code example found in this blog might look like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Jeffrey')
#=> prints 'Hi, Jeffrey' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

##Tools and workflow
A productive workflow is incredibly important for a webdeveloper. You use your tools everyday, so better know your way around them. A great list of valuable tools can be found on <a  target="_blank" href="http://hackdesign.org/toolkit"> hackdesign's toolkit page</a>.
My favorite IDE is definitely <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. Simple, powerful and with the right packages, incredibly extensible to your likings.

I use a 15 inch retina MacBook Pro as my primary machine. So expect my blog posts concerning development & design to be mostly OS X oriented. If you can't follow along cause you use an other machine, my apology.

More about my workflow in a later post as well...

#Design
It's sufficient to say that my future posts will involve topics like typhography, UX and webdesign as well. Just don't expect logo design talk from me though, I definitely know my kryptonite. Even though I have book knowledge about logo design and I enjoy beautiful designed logo's. I just can't create a satisfying logo, period.
This being said, I think the most appealing designs are: subtle animated, minimal, clean and typgraphical oriented webdesigns. I can't wait to address some of my designs and thoughts about this in future posts.

#About me
My full name is Jeffrey Nijstad. I dare to say that I'm a passionate webdeveloper and webdesigner. Currently residing in the Netherlands, where I grew up and finished college.

But on the 14th of february, 9 days from now, I'll be making a big leap of faith. I'll move to Jakarta, Indonesia, hoping to start a new adventure. Plans? Find a job where I'm able to learn a lot, collabrate in a modern and fun matter and gain a lot of valuable experience. Furthermore I plan on working from coffeeshops, meet and collabrate with new passionate people, collabrate with a big prospective client I can't disclose just yet and, last but not least, enjoy the beautiful and rich scenery Indonesia has to offer.
If you know a job opportunity or just want to meetup in Indonesia, just shoot me an <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#106;&#110;&#105;&#106;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#100;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email</a>.

Thank you for reading (a part of) my first post.
